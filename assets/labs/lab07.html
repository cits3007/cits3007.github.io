<p>We will be using the <a href="https://doxygen.nl">Doxygen</a>
documentation tool. Install it in your VM with</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends doxygen graphviz</code></pre>
<p>We will also make use of the <a href="https://libcheck.github.io/check/index.html">Check</a> unit

<h2 id="testing-documentation-and-apis">2. Testing, documentation and
APIs</h2>
<p>The aim of testing is to identify and remove <em>defects</em> from a
project – mistakes in the source code or configuration/data files that
cause it to deviate from its prescribed behaviour.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>
<em>Vulnerabilities</em> are a particular class of defects where the
resulting failure compromises security goals for a system.</p>
<p>To be able to test a program, or part of it, we have to know what its
intended behaviour <em>is</em>, or by definition we can’t test it. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_documentation"><em>Documentation</em></a>
is therefore an important part of any software project. The
documentation for a function or other piece of code tells us what it
<em>should</em> do, and testing tries to find situations in which the
code does something else.</p>
<p>A program specification defines the behaviour expected of an entire
program, and can be used directly for testing that program. However, it
doesn’t say anything about the behaviour of individual functions. Those
are normally documented within the source file that contains them, and
the documentation for all public-facing functions, macros and data
structures forms the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API">API</a>
(“Application Programming Interface”) for that file.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="documenting-an-api">2.1. Documenting an API</h3>
<p>Typically, the specification documentation for functions is contained
in documentation <em>blocks</em>: specially formatted comments or
annotations which can be extracted and displayed by documentation tools.
For example, the documentation block below is from a previous year’s
project:</p>

<p>Documentation blocks normally have some way of formatting the
documentation for easy reading, of documenting particular parts of a
function (like parameters or the return value), and of referring to
other, related functions. In this lab, we will use the <a href="https://doxygen.nl">Doxygen</a> tool, which is expressly designed
for extracting API documentation from C and C++ files. It uses <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax">Markdown</a>
conventions for formatting, and special tags (like <code>\param</code>,
<code>\return</code> and <code>\ref</code>) to pick out particular
portions of a function – these are described in the Doxygen tool’s <a href="https://doxygen.nl/manual/commands.html">documentation</a>. You
likely have encountered similar tools to Doxygen previously for other
languages: Java uses the <a href="https://www.oracle.com/au/technical-resources/articles/java/javadoc-tool.html"><code>javadoc</code></a>
tool, Python projects typically use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pydoc.html"><code>pydoc</code></a>
or <a href="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/"><code>sphinx</code></a>, Rust
uses <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustdoc/what-is-rustdoc.html"><code>rustdoc</code></a>,
and Haskell uses <a href="https://haskell-haddock.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"><code>haddock</code></a>.</p>
<p>Note that documentation blocks do <em>not</em> serve the same purpose
as inline comments (comments contained within the body of a function).
(In fact, in some languages, documentation blocks may not be comments at
all. Python uses <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0257/">strings
instead of comments</a>, and Rust internally uses the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustdoc/write-documentation/the-doc-attribute.html"><code>#[doc]</code>
annotation</a>.) Documentation blocks should <em>always</em> be included
for any function that forms part of an API, so that other programmers
know how to <em>use</em> that function, and documentation blocks can be
as extensive as needed. If you are using a C library – say, the FLAC
library, which allows you to encode, decode and manipulate audio files
in the FLAC format – then your primary way of knowing what the functions
in that library do is by referring to the <a href="https://xiph.org/flac/api/group__flac.html">API documentation</a>.
Not only do you not need to know what any inline comments say, but for
commercial software libraries, you might not have any access to them or
to the source code at all.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>In contrast to documentation blocks, <em>inline</em> comments are
<em>only</em> for the use of programmers who need to fix or enhance
existing functions, and typically should be used sparingly – excessive
inline commenting makes code harder to read. In general, inline comments
should not say <em>what</em> the code is doing – anyone who understands
the programming language should be able to see that – but rather
<em>why</em> it is doing it.</p>

<div class="block-caption">
<p>Inline commenting of your code</p>
</div>
<p>Don’t over-comment your code! In this unit, we value clarity and
conciseness. Over-commenting can detract from both, and it will be
difficult to achieve high marks if your code is excessively or
unnecessarily commented.</p>
<p>You should assume that the person marking your code is an experienced
C programmer and does not require explanations of basic language
features.</p>
<p>If you <em>do</em> feel you need to add inline comments, then focus
on explaining <em>why</em> you are doing something, rather than what you
are doing. The code itself should make the ‘what’ clear; comments should
provide additional context or reasoning.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="running-doxygen">2.2. Running <code>doxygen</code></h3>
<p>Ensure you have a copy of your group’s project code available, and
download it into your development environment. (Or, if you don’t have it
quickly available, you can also</p>
<p>Change directory to your directory containing your source code, and
run <code>doxygen -g</code>. It generates a file called
<code>Doxyfile</code>, used to configure the exact contents and
formatting of the API documentation for a project. To work well with a C
project, a few changes are needed – you can download a Doxyfile with
these changes in the code .zip file for this lab.</p>
<p>Specific changes we make to the original Doxyfile include
changing</p>
<ul>
<li><code>INPUT</code> to <code>src</code></li>
<li><code>OPTIMIZE_OUTPUT_FOR_C</code> to <code>YES</code></li>
<li><code>RECURSIVE</code> to <code>YES</code></li>
<li><code>SOURCE_BROWSER</code> to <code>YES</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Download and extract the <code>Doxyfile</code> from that zip file,
and run the command <code>doxygen</code>. The Doxygen tool will use the
configuration contained in the <code>Doxyfile</code> configuration file
to generate HTML documentation contained in an <code>html</code>
subdirectory of your project.</p>
<p>The easiest way of viewing the HTML documentation is usually by using
an editor like VS Code to open the HTML files in the development VM;
alternatively, it’s possible to copy the files from the development VM
to the host – see <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27384596/vagrant-how-to-sync-folder-from-guest-back-to-host/46943065#46943065">this
StackOverflow</a> answer.</p>
<p>Some of the functions in the project code already have documentation
blocks written for them (e.g. <code>handle_login</code>), but others do
not. As you work through the project, it’s a good idea to update the
documentation blocks based on your understanding of what services the
different functions perform, and what they require from the caller in
return.</p>

<p>Doxygen features</p>
</div>
<p>Doxygen has a number of features we will not use, but which are very
useful for exploring the structure of large codebases. It can create
UML-style diagrams of the classes or functions contained in the code, as
well as showing graphically which functions or methods make use of
others. You can read more about those features <a href="https://www.doxygen.nl/manual/diagrams.html">here</a>.</p>

</ul>
<h3 id="writing-your-project-code">2.3. Writing your project code</h3>
<p>The .zip file for this lab contains an alternative Makefile, together
with some additional files, that you may find useful for the
project.</p>
<p>The new files include the following features:</p>
<dl>
<dt><em>A Makefile with a range of additional warning and error flags
enabled</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>We already recommend you compile all code for this unit with
<code>-Wall -Wextra -pedantic-errors</code>. The Makefile for this
week’s lab includes a Make variable <code>EXTRA_CFLAGS</code> which
defines a number of other warning and error options which can stop you
making mistakes in your code.</p>
<p>Development teams, particularly in security-sensitive environments,
frequently use flags like these to enforce best practices and improve
the overall quality of the code.</p>
<p>As we’ve seen in previous labs, <code>-pedantic-errors</code>
enforces stricter compliance with the C standard – it turns any
non-standard behaviour into an error, which helps catch potentially
problematic code that might work on some compilers but is technically
not conforming to the C standard. This is useful to ensure that code
behaves consistently across different compilers.</p>
<p>The option <code>-Werror=vla</code> turns warnings about
<strong>Variable Length Arrays (VLAs)</strong> into errors. VLAs are
arrays whose size is determined at runtime, which can lead to stack
overflows, attacker induced [stack clashes], or unpredictable behaviour
if not carefully managed. Banning VLAs can enhance the stability and
predictability of the program, which is especially important in
security-sensitive code.</p>
<p>You might be familiar with GCC warning about “implicitly defined
functions”; the <code>-Werror=implicit-function-declaration</code>
option turns that too into an error. In C, using a function before its
declaration can lead to unpredictable behaviour – the compiler is forced
to make assumptions about the parameters and return type which are often
incorrect. By making this an error, code is forced to be more explicit,
improving reliability and reducing the risk of bugs.</p>

<dt><em>A “banned.h” header file, of functions you shouldn’t be
using</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>A <code>banned.h</code> file is a special header file used in some
development environments to explicitly prohibit the use of certain
functions or programming practices that the development team has decided
should <strong>never</strong> be used in their codebase. It helps
enforce coding standards and ensures that developers avoid potentially
dangerous or inappropriate behaviour in their code.</p>
<p>This file typically contains declarations of functions that are
considered unsafe, inappropriate, or incompatible with the design goals
of the project. The functions in this list are usually replaced by
safer, more controlled alternatives that adhere to the project’s
standards.</p>
<p>For example, the <code>gets()</code> function in C is notorious for
its potential to cause buffer overflows, as it doesn’t check the size of
the input. A team might take the very reasonable decision to ban the use
of <code>gets()</code> (and possibly other functions like
<code>scanf()</code>) in the project because these can easily be
exploited by attackers if used improperly.</p>
<p><code>FILE</code> pointer-based I/O functions like
<code>fopen()</code>, <code>fprintf()</code>, and <code>fclose()</code>
might be banned in certain projects because they are not well-suited for
structured logging or when multiple components need to interact cleanly
with each other. Instead, the team may use custom logging functions or
more explicit input/output management that avoids relying on global
<code>stdout</code> or <code>stderr</code> (which can create conflicts
or problems during testing, or in environments such as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp_questions/comments/11kvn9k/whats_the_best_approach_when_multiple_threads/"><strong>multi-threaded</strong>
or <strong>multi-process</strong> systems</a>). The
<code>banned.h</code> header we include in this week’s code bans such
functions for exactly this reason – no code in CITS3007 assessments is
supposed to print to <code>stdout</code> or <code>stderr</code> unless
explicitly asked to.</p>
<p>A typical <code>banned.h</code> might look like this:</p>

<p>(This is not exactly the way ours operates, but gives you an idea of
how they look.)</p>
<p>When the <code>banned.h</code> file is included in the source code
(usually by a central header that is included throughout the project),
the compiler will generate warnings (or errors, depending on the project
settings) whenever one of the banned functions is used. This prevents
developers from accidentally using functions that are considered unsafe,
inappropriate, or incompatible with the project’s design principles.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>A <code>check_account.ts</code> set of example unit
tests</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Testing is important in any software project, but it is absolutely
critical in a security-conscious environment. Security vulnerabilities
often arise from subtle bugs: memory errors, unexpected edge cases, or
incorrect assumptions about how code behaves. Thorough testing helps to
catch these problems early, before they can become serious
vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>In this lab, we show how to use the <code>libcheck</code> framework,
which is specifically designed for C development. It provides
<strong>process isolation</strong>, meaning that if a test crashes or
triggers a memory error, it won’t crash the entire test suite – only the
individual test process. This is extremely useful when writing
security-sensitive code, because it allows you to aggressively test
error handling and boundary cases without destabilising the test
harness.</p>
<p>You are welcome to use any other C testing framework you are
comfortable with, but consistent, thorough, and automated testing is
expected. Good testing practices are essential not just for correctness,
but also for security: well-tested code is much harder to exploit.</p>
<p>Take a look at some of the tests in <code>check_account.ts</code> and
see if you can follow what they are doing. Consider other tests – are
there <em>edge cases</em> you can identify? What if some string input is
at the largest size it can plausibly be for a parameter, or the smallest
size – what will happen? Are degenerate cases (e.g. empty strings)
allowed for some or all string parameters, and if so, does your code
behave correctly when they are passed? What about functions like
<code>account_update_password</code> – how should they behave if
implemented correctly? (One question to think about: when invoked twice
with the same password, do you expect
<code>account_update_password</code> to produce the same result, or a
different one?)</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>When testing your project, you’ll need to compile your code with a
<em>range</em> of optimizations and sanitizers (as well as making use of
the static analysers we have looked at). Some warnings and sanitizers
only work well when code is quite highly optimized (option
<code>-O2</code> to GCC), and high optimization levels also often elicit
bugs you otherwise wouldn’t have identified. But testing at low
optimization levels is useful too – entirely different bugs may
appear.</p>
<h3 id="writing-and-running-tests">2.4. Writing and running tests</h3>
<p>Once a specification is available for a function (or even before
then!), it’s possible to start writing tests for it. A test is meant to
look at the behaviour of a system or function in response to some input,
and make sure that it aligns with what we expect.</p>
<p>It can be useful to think of a test as being composed of three
parts</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Arrange</strong></li>
<li><strong>Act</strong></li>
<li><strong>Assert</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>In C, we often also need to add a fourth part,
“<strong>Cleanup</strong>”. Some languages have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_(computer_science)">automatic
memory and resource management</a> – when open files or allocated memory
are no longer in use, they are “garbage collected” – but C is not one of
these. In C, it’s up to the programmer to ensure they dispose of
resources after use (for instance by <code>free()</code>-ing allocated
memory and closing open files).</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Arrange</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>means preparing whatever resources are required for our test. This
could include initializing data structures needed, creating and
populating files or database, or starting programs running (say, a
webserver).</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Act</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>means invoking the behavior we want to test. In C, this will
typically mean calling a function, which we call the <em>function under
test</em>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Assert</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>means to look at the resulting state of the system and see if it is
what we expected. If a function returns a value, it might mean checking
to make sure that value is the correct one. If the function instead
writes data to a file or database, it might mean examining the file or
database to see whether the changes made are the ones we expected.
Sometimes <strong>assert</strong>ing just requires comparing two values,
but other times we might need to make a more thorough investigation.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>In C, <strong>cleanup</strong> means to dispose of any used
resources, and to make sure the test we’ve just run won’t interfere with
the results of any future tests.</p>
<p>C is a particularly challenging language to write tests for, because
a misbehaving function under test can overwrite the stack frame of the
function that’s calling it, meaning we can no longer rely on the results
of our test.</p>
<p>It’s a good idea, therefore, to enable any dynamic checks we can that
will help us catch misbehaviour like this – for instance, by using the
<a href="https://github.com/google/sanitizers">Google sanitizers</a> or
tools like <a href="https://valgrind.org">Valgrind</a>. Additionally,
the <a href="https://libcheck.github.io/check/index.html">Check</a>
unit-testing framework, which we use in this lab, by default uses the
<code>fork()</code> system call to run tests in a separate address space
from the test framework, which prevents the framework from being
affected by any memory corruption that occurs.</p>
<p>If you run <code>make test</code>, the Makefile will</p>
<ul>
<li>compile your code (if not already done)</li>
<li>use the <a href="https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/focal/man1/checkmk.1.html"><code>checkmk</code></a>
tool to generate “<code>.c</code>” files from the tests contained in
<code>check_account.ts</code>, and</li>
<li>compile and run the tests.</li>
</ul>
<p>The use of <code>checkmk</code> isn’t necessary – we could write the
tests by hand in C if we wanted – but it saves us having to write some
repetitive boilerplate code.</p>
<p>Try running</p>
<pre><code>$ make test</code></pre>
<p>to see the Check framework in action. You should see that several
tests were run, perhaps that some pass, and perhaps that others
failed.</p>
<p>Check can output results in <a href="https://libcheck.github.io/check/doc/check_html/check_4.html#Test-Logging">multiple
formats</a>. You might find the output of the <code>check_account</code>
binary more readable if you run it with the following environment
variables and options:</p>
<pre><code>CK_TAP_LOG_FILE_NAME=- prove --verbose ./check_account</code></pre>
<p>Here, <code>make check_account</code> builds our test-runner program.
<code>CK_TAP_LOG_FILE_NAME=-</code> tells it to output results using the
<a href="https://testanything.org">“TAP” format</a> for test results,
and <code>prove</code> is a Perl program which formats those results and
summarizes them (see <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/prove"><code>man prove</code></a> for
details). Leaving off the “<code>--verbose</code>” flag to
<code>prove</code> will result in just a summary being printed.</p>
<p>Try and adjust the Makefile so that your code is compiled and run
with the UBSan and ASan sanitizers (look at previous labs for hints on
how to do so). MSan (memory sanitizer) is another dynamic analyser worth
looking at, but note that it can’t be enabled at the same time as ASan –
they instrument your code in incompatible ways.</p>
<p>It’s a good idea to enable the sanitizers while developing your
project. If they detect memory errors, you may need to debug your
program using <code>gdb</code>. The output of AddressSanitizer should
includes a stack trace which reveals where the bug was detected.
(Include the “-g” option to gcc for better information). If running</p>
<pre><code>$ gdb -tui ./check_account</code></pre>
<p>to track down what causes a bug, you probably will want to set the
environment variable <code>CK_FORK</code> to “<code>no</code>”, like
this:</p>
<pre><code>$ CK_FORK=no gdb -tui ./check_account</code></pre>
<p>This inhibits Check’s usual behaviour of <code>fork</code>ing off a
separate process in which to run each test.</p>
<h3 id="project-work">2.5. Project work</h3>
<p>Although your project should be completed in your own group, it’s
fine to discussing with other students or the lab facilitators the
general concepts of testing, and how you might come up with more tests
for your code – in fact, this is encouraged. Besides the tests contained
in the .ts file, what additional tests will you need? How will you
ensure your test expectations are correct?</p>

### 2.6. "Mock" objects

It's often a good idea to make our tests fast, so they're quick and easy
to run. If tests take too long to run, developers will avoid running
them, which leads to poor quality code. When writing *unit* tests --
tests which examine the behaviour of a very smal part of the system --
it's also often a good idea to minimize our tests' dependencies on
external resources, like files and database.

For that reason, it can be useful to use "mock" resources, which "stand
in" for a real resource, but are quicker to create. 
The Check framework does not provide any special support for creating
mocks, but we can use some of the Linux kernel's features to
build our own.
On Linux, the [`memfd_create`][memfd] system call creates a "file"-like
object which exists purely in memory. Accessing such files is faster
than making accesses to disk.
In the skeleton code for the CITS3007 project, the
`mock_file()` function in `tests/test_utils.c` uses `memfd_create`
to create an in-memory file with any desired content.
(The protopye and documentation are in tests/test_utils.h`).

[memfd]: https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/memfd_create.2.html

Other unit testing frameworks provide more extensive support
for mock objects. For instance, the [cmocka][cmocka] test framework
allows for *functions* to be mocked: the framework allows
a C function to be "swapped out", and replaced by a "mock" function
generated by the framework. The [LWN.net][lwn] site has an article on
using mock objects in C, at <https://lwn.net/Articles/558106/>.
We don't cover the cmocka framework in detail in this unit,
but provide it as a resource you may find useful when tackling the
project.

[cmocka]: https://cmocka.org  
[lwn]: https://lwn.net/

### 2.7. Other tests

The tests provided in the skeleton Curdle code
do not test the `crypto()` function itself.
The specification for that function says that it uses a particular
file, "` /var/lib/curdle/scores`", to store scores in, that it should
be run as part of a setuid program, and that the `curdle` user
should be owner of the program executable.

How might we test these requirements?

<li id="fn1"><p>We use the terms “defect” and “failure” generally in
line with their definitions in ISO/IEC/IEEE standard 24765(“Systems and
software engineering – Vocabulary”). A <em>failure</em> is deviation of
the behaviour of a system from its specification, and a <em>defect</em>
is an error or fault in the static artifacts (software code,
configuration or data files, or hardware) of a system which, if
uncorrected, can give rise to a failure.<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn2"><p>In some languages, like Java and Rust, the
<strong>implementations</strong> of datatypes, functions or methods are
located in the same place as their <strong>specification</strong>.
Individual items can usually be declared <em>public</em> or
<em>private</em>.<br />
   In other languages, like C and C++, the implementations are in a
different file (the <code>.c</code> or <code>.cpp</code>) file to the
specifications (which appear in a header file, with extension
<code>.h</code> or <code>.hpp</code>).<br />
   And some other languages yet are a sort of combination, like Ada and
Haskell. In those languages, the implementation appears in the body of
the file, and a specification near the top in a module or package
“header”.<br />
   Best practice in C is to document the <em>public</em> parts of a
<code>.c</code> file in the header file, to keep the implementations in
the <code>.c</code> file, and for everything that isn’t intended to be
public to be made <code>static</code> (private).<br />
   However, to keep things simple in the project, we expect project
groups only to submit <code>.c</code> files, and to put documentation
headers in the <code>.c</code> files if needed – not in the
