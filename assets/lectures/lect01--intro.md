### What is this unit about?

This unit is about \alert{software security}, which is part of
the larger field of \alert{information security}.

We look at weaknesses (vulnerabilities) that can be present in
software systems, and can lead to security being compromised.

We ask: How can we build software that is more secure?

And we look at two main approaches:

- *finding* vulnerabilities in existing software
- *avoiding* vulnerabilities in new software
  (whether at the design or the implementation phases)

### Related areas

Some areas we *don't* cover (or, not in detail):

- The job of administering and operating software once it
  *is* developed is part of \alert{system administration} or \alert{security
  administration}.

<!-- -->

- We look at security testing -- the process of attempting to find vulnerabilities in software --
  but it is a large area, and we cannot cover it all.
  - In particular, \alert{penetration testing} -- simulating attacks on a computer system --
    is the subject of a separate unit (CITS3006).

<!-- -->

- We touch on ways that computer hardware can assist in developing secure software --
  but \alert{secure hardware design} is its own subject.
  - (UWA does not have a unit dedicated to it, although some universities
    such as [MIT University do][hardsec].)

### Why care?

Everyone has items of personal information stored
in many different computer systems ...

How happy are you for others to access this information? Does it
matter who is doing the accessing?

### Cost of cyber-crime

Estimates of the annual cost of cyber crime to the Australian economy range
from $33 billion[^acsc-fn] to $42 billion[^phair-fn].

This amounts to about 2% of Australia's annual GDP (Gross Domestic Product) of $US 1.3 trillion.

### Challenges

Large-scale computer data breaches have been occurring since at least 1984,[^kalat-fn]
and organisations still seem unable to adequately protect
users' data:[^sa-fn]

### Challenges

\small

Often, we know basic bad practices to avoid, and good ones to adopt -- but
organizations still ignore these very basic security practices.[^whittaker-fn]

### Preventing computer security failures

Many (but not all) security failures can be prevented
through improved coding practices:

- validating input received from untrusted sources
- sanitizing or escaping output
- requiring authentication for all resources not specifically
  intended to be public
- not disclosing sensitive information in error responses/pages
- implementing the "Principle of Least Privilege" -- granting
  users, systems or programs only the access they need
  in order to perform their tasks
- encrypting the transmission of all sensitive information
- avoiding insecure uses of memory

### Unit website

Nearly all content for the unit will be available from the unit website,
at <https://cits3007.arranstewart.io/>.

The easiest way to find it is to search on Bing or Google
for "CITS3007 github", or to bookmark the site.

`\begin{center}`{=latex}
![](lect01-images/website.png){ width=100% }
`\end{center}`{=latex}

All of the content for the site is generated from a GitHub repository
at <https://github.com/cits3007/cits3007.github.io>.

### Unit website


You **won't** need to visit the Blackboard LMS to obtain teaching materials --
you'll only need to visit it to access lecture recordings.

### Assessments and review exercises

Assessments (and non-assessed review exercises) will be available via
the [CSSE Moodle server][jin], at <https://quiz.jinhong.org/>.

[jin]: https://quiz.jinhong.org/

You should register an account on Moodle using your UWA email address, and
self-enrol in the unit "CITS3007 Secure Coding (2025s1)".

### Announcements

- Announcements will be made in lectures, and on the Moodle CITS3007
  discussion forum.
- It's important to check the forum regularly -- at least once a week.


### Problems

::: block

####

Who should I contact if I have an issue?

:::

- `For most matters -- the unit coordinator (UC), Arran`{=latex}

  - If it's a problem other students are likely to have,
    it's suggested you post to the discussion forum
    so other students can benefit from the answer.
  - If you require personal communication with the UC,
    feel free to email me on cits3007-pmc@uwa.edu.au.

&nbsp;

- In labs -- feel free to ask the lab facilitators
  about any of the teaching and learning materials
  presented in labs or lectures.




### Unit contact hours – lectures


- You should attend one lecture (1 hour 50 mins) per week -- I recommend attending
  in person (so you can ask and answer questions), but if you are unable
  to attend, you can also watch the recorded lecture.

  Recorded lectures are available via the university's
  LMS, at <https://lms.uwa.edu.au/>.
- You'll get more out of lectures if you read the lecture slides (and
  work through the recommended reading) *before* the lecture.

  Then the lecture time can be spent clarifying your understanding
  of the material.

### Unit contact hours – lectures

- I aim to have slides for the week posted on the unit website
  early in the week (usually Monday).
  - However, during busy teaching weeks, it's possible they might not go up
    until the day of the lecture. In that case, the unit [FAQ][previous-years]
    gives advice on where to find slides from last year's lectures.

[previous-years]: https://cits3007.arranstewart.io/faq/#previous-content

### Unit contact hours – labs


- You should attend one lab (1 hour 50 mins) each week, starting in week
  *two*.\
  If there is room available for you, you are welcome to attend other
  lab sessions as well. (See the website to find the times for
  labs other than the one you're allocated to.)
- In the labs, we will work through practical exercises
  related to the unit material.
- You will need a laptop for the labs -- we'll be using
  software (and making use of techniques) that aren't permitted
  to be installed on university servers.

### Lecture slides and lab worksheets

- Lecture slides and lab worksheets will go up on the website as the
  semester progresses.

### Non-timetabled hours

A six-point unit is deemed to be equivalent to one quarter of a
full-time workload, so you are expected to commit 10--12 hours
per week to the unit, averaged over the entire semester.

Outside of the
contact hours (3 hours per week) for the unit, the remainder of your
time should be spent reading the recommended reading, attempting
exercises and working on assignment tasks.

### Moodle exercises

Periodically, I'll post (unassessed) exercises on the CSSE department's
[Moodle](https://quiz.jinhong.org/) server.

You can complete these in your own time, and
they will help you improve your understanding of secure coding concepts.

More
information about Moodle will be available in the first lab.


### CITS3007 unit content

See the CITS3007 website at <https://cits3007.arranstewart.io/schedule/>
for the list of topics covered.

The main topics are:

- memory safety and arithmetic errors
- inter-process communication and input validation
- accessing files and resources safely
- cryptography
- secure software development processes

### Books you should have

You'll need access to a [good C textbook][good-c] in order to do well in the unit.

[good-c]:  https://cits3007.arranstewart.io/resources/#c-programming

YouTube videos or online tutorials will **not** be sufficient!

C is fairly small, as languages go, but some of the details relating to security are subtle.

An \alert{operating systems} textbook will also be helpful -- see [here][os-text].

[os-text]: https://cits3007.arranstewart.io/resources/#operating-systems

These aren't textbooks, per se -- they cover recommended prior knowledge you
should have before starting the unit.

### Recommended readings

There is no one textbook that covers all the unit content.

Instead, there are recommended readings for each week, listed
on the unit schedule:

- <https://cits3007.arranstewart.io/schedule>

If you are finding any of the concepts difficult, the recommended
readings are a good place to look for clarification.

Working through the readings *before* lectures will also make lectures
more useful to you, since you won't be encountering topics for the first time.

Copies of readings should be available via the UWA Library (some as hard-copy textbooks,
some as online extracts) -- look in the LMS under "Unit Readings".


### Assessment

The assessment for CITS3007 consists of several quizzes, a group project, and a final examination.

Quizzes are normally in weeks 4, 7 and 11 -- but check the announcements on Moodle for more
information.

Except for the first quiz (which is completely take-home), assessments will typically require
you to demonstrate some component or aspect of the assessment
in the lab and have that signed off by lab facilitator.

Details will also be posted on the Assessment page of the unit website at:

- <https://cits3007.arranstewart.io/assessment/>

Quizzes are to be done individually.


### Feedback

There'll be an opportunity to give feedback on how
the unit is going around week 5 -- we'll post a survey
form in MS Teams.

Please do make use of the opportunity to comment
on the course!

There is *also* an opportunity to provide feedback via
the SELT (Student Experience of Learning and Teaching) survey[^selt]
at the end of semester -- but that will come too late
for us to make any changes *this* semester.

[^selt]: See [SELT-Policy.doc](https://www.uwa.edu.au/policy/-/media/Project/UWA/UWA/Policy-Library/Policy/Teaching-and-Research-Training/Learning-and-Teaching/SELT/SELT-Policy.doc) (Word document) for UWA's SELT policy.


### Advisable prior studies

Although the prerequisite for this unit is only 12 points of programming, you
are advised to take this unit in the third year of your course to ensure you have a
comprehensive understanding of computer systems, and will be able to do well in this
unit.

In particular, it's recommended you complete CITS2002 Systems Programming before
commencing this unit.

### Assessment tips -- tests and exams

\small

- Quizzes are intended to assess not just theoretical
  knowledge but *practical* skills, so they're done on computer, and will often
  ask you to complete exercises
  using the standard [CITS3007 development environment](/faq/#cits3007-sde)
  (more on this in the first lab).

  So it's a good idea to have access to the development environment while completing
  them.
- You're encouraged to use the development environment to work out or check your
  answers.

### Assessment tips -- written work

\small

- The project and exam will include not just programming, but explaining and
  justifying security approaches in English.

  Communicating with others -- for instance, documenting your work, writing
  a security testing plan, or justifying a particular technical approach -- is an important
  part of software engineering.

### Assessment tips -- written work (cont'd)

\small


- I suggest taking a look at the UWA Library's "Study support"
  web pages at
  <https://www.uwa.edu.au/library/Help-and-support/Study-support>,
  especially the Communication and Research Skills (CARS) module and materials.

  These web pages provide advice on writing tasks like:

  - finding, evaluating and critiquing evidence
  - making an argument
  - writing a report

- Make sure you're careful in your use of terminology. If your answer
  is unclear or confusing, you are unlikely to be awarded
  high marks for an assessment.

### Assessment tips -- programming work

\small

- Security-critical code doesn't just need to do the "right thing" --
  it needs to be easily understood and maintained by others, so that it can be *verified* to do the right thing.
- Your code is expected to be clearly written, well-formatted, and easy for others to understand.
- It's better to be *clear* than *clever*. Brian Kernighan (who co-authored the
  first C programming book), said

  \vspace{0.5em}

  > Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it.

::: notes

Also given as:

"Everyone knows that debugging is twice as hard as writing a program in the first place. So if
you're as clever as you can be when you write it, how will you ever debug it?"


:::

### Assessment tips -- programming work (cont'd)

\small

- In the lectures and labs, we'll look at various techniques
  that can be applied to improve the security of your code.
- In the assessments, it will be up to you to actually *use* them.
- For instance, you'll be expected to enable your compiler's warnings,
  use [static][stat-an] and [dynamic analysis][dyn-an] on your code to
  detect problems, and [test][testing] your code.

[stat-an]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_program_analysis
[dyn-an]:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_sanitizer
[testing]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_testing?

### Programming environment

We will be using the C programming language (and occasionally, Python).

Project code will be expected to compile and run correctly
on a standard Linux environment[^standard-dev] which we provide
in the form of virtual machine (VM) images.

If assessments ever refer to "the CITS3007 standard development
environment", this is the environment they mean.

[^standard-dev]: The standard environment contains C development tools
  installed on an Ubuntu 20.04 Linux distribution, running Linux
  kernel version 5.4.0 on an x86-64 processor.

### Programming environment, cont'd

The VM images are hosted at

- <https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/vagrant/discover/arranstewart/cits3007-ubuntu2004>

and in the first lab we will look at how you can access them
using the open source tools VirtualBox and Vagrant.

**NB:** \
Students using M1 series Macs will not be able to use VirtualBox --
those students will need to use [UTM][utm], an alternative
virtualization package.

# Security introduction

### Security goals

Traditionally, information security is based on three
goals ("C I A"):

- \alert{Confidentiality} -- preventing the unauthorised disclosure of
  information
- \alert{Integrity} -- preventing the unauthorised modification of information
- \alert{Availability} -- ensuring timely and reliable access to and use of information
  by authorised users

### Safety versus security

\small

- Generally when we talk about software security, we mean
  ensuring that bad things don't happen due to *deliberate*
  actions by others.
- But a related goal is software *safety*, which is ensuring
  that bad things don't happen, whether deliberate or not.

`\begin{center}`{=latex}
![](lect01-images/software-safety.eps){ width=65% }
`\end{center}`{=latex}

### Safety versus security


- The security goals we mentioned can often be compromised by accident, as well as
  intentionally --
  - confidentiality can be threatened by (say) accidentally leaving
    a USB drive full of employee details in a car-park
  - integrity can be threatened if we fail to keep proper backups
    and suffer a power outage
  - availability can be threatened if we make a mistake in routing
    Internet traffic


### Accidental compromise

`\begin{center}`{=latex}
![](lect01-images/sydney-bin.png){ width=75% }
`\end{center}`{=latex}

\scriptsize

*"More than 700 public patients and hundreds more in the private system have had their privacy breached after letters from their specialists to GPs were found dumped in a Sydney bin."*[^sydney-bin-fn]

[^sydney-bin-fn]: See Sarah Gerathy, "[Confidential hospital patient records found dumped in Sydney bin][sydney-bin]" (ABC News, 21 April 2017)


[sydney-bin]: https://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-04-21/confidential-health-records-found-dumped-in-sydney-bin/8460694


### Other security goals

Most security experts augment the "C I A" triad with additional
goals; two commonly proposed ones are:

- \alert{Authenticity} -- being confident in or able to verify the genuineness
  of a message or information
- \alert{Accountability} -- the ability to trace actions back uniquely to the
  entity that took those actions. \
  (Or, sometimes, \alert{Non-repudiation} -- the creation of evidence that
  an action has occurred, so that a user cannot later falsely deny
  taking that action.)

### Example -- alleged training email


```{=latex}
\begin{columns}[t]
\begin{column}{0.30\textwidth}
```

\footnotesize

I received the following email, purporting
to be from UWA's IT Services.\

&nbsp;

Is it genuine?



```{=latex}
\end{column}
\begin{column}{0.70\textwidth}
```

`\begin{center}`{=latex}
![](lect01-images/cybersec-training.png){ width=100% }
`\end{center}`{=latex}

&nbsp;



```{=latex}
\end{column}
\end{columns}
```

### Example -- alleged training email

\small

About the email:

- It asks me to click on a non-UWA link, <https://uwa.securityeducation.com/>,
  which in turn asks me to provide my UWA user ID and password.
- IT Service's page on phishing emails[^uwa-phish] says that
  "Any email from a legitimate business such as the University or your bank
  will give a telephone number and postal address", which this email does not.

\pause

&nbsp;

- In fact, the email *is* from UWA's IT services.

-->

### Threats, vulnerabilities, incidents & attacks

These concepts all relate to the ways in which
information security can be or is compromised.

- \alert{Threat}: Anything that has the potential to cause harm
  or loss.

  - Threats can be *natural threats* (floods, hurricanes, solar flares),
    *unintentional threats* (an intern accidentally deletes everything
    from your server's filesystem), or *intentional threats* (activities done deliberately:
    e.g. altering or deliberately deleting server data).
  - Could be thought of as "a source of danger".

  When we talk about *security* threats, we mean
  harm or loss due to a compromise of a security goal.

::: notes

adapted from Stallings & Brown, Computer Security, 3rd edn,
table 1.1

and from the net in general

:::


### Threats, vulnerabilities, incidents & attacks

- \alert{Vulnerability}: A flaw or weakness in a system's design, implementation
  or configuration that could be exploited to compromise security.

  Some examples:

  - Hard-coded default passwords
  - Buffer overflows
  - Poor validation and sanitization of program input

### Threats, vulnerabilities, incidents & attacks

- \alert{Attack}: A situation where someone (the attacker) deliberately exploits
  a vulnerability and compromises security goals.
- \alert{Incident}: Much the same, except it arises from a non-deliberate act.
  Security incidents can still be costly and harmful, however, so
  we need to take them into account.
