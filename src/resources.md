## Textbooks

There is no one textbook that covers all the unit topics, but the [unit
schedule](/schedule) lists recommended readings on various topics.

What you *do* need is access to a good C textbook -- see [here](#c-programming){ class="hi-pri" }.
C is a fairly small language, but some of the details relating to security are subtle.

An operating systems textbook will also be helpful -- see [here](#operating-systems){ class="hi-pri" }.

As noted on the [welcome page](/#assumed-knowledge), it's assumed you
are already familiar with a procedural or OO programming language.
It's also advisable to have completed [CITS2002 Systems
Programming][cits2002], which covers operating systems
and C programming, as well as the basics of using the Linux
command-line.
(For further information, see the unit FAQ, under
[**"Do I need to have completed CITS2002 before enrolling in
CITS3007?"**](/faq#advisable-study).)



[cits2002]: https://teaching.csse.uwa.edu.au/units/CITS2002/

If you are after textbooks which cover the recommended prior
knowledge, the following sections give some suggestions.

### The Linux command line

The content of this unit assumes you understand how to
navigate a Unix-like operating system using the command-line,
perform basic file operations, and build C projects using
[`gcc`][gcc] and [GNU Make][make].

[gcc]: https://gcc.gnu.org
[make]: https://www.gnu.org/software/make/

(If you've not used the command-line interface of a Unix-like operating system
much, you should get familiar with it. Besides being useful for this unit,
often in industry when working with cloud VMs, the command-line is the
only way you have of accessing them.)

One good tutorial on the Linux command-line is

- <https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/>

and there's also a free PDF guide to using the Linux command line: [*The Linux
Command Line*][lincomm], by William Shotts.

[lincomm]: http://linuxcommand.org/tlcl.php

The recommended editor for this unit is [`vim`](https://www.vim.org),
though if you are already familiar with Emacs you are welcome to use
that instead. You will not always be able to use a GUI editor such
as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) â€“ the
configuration details we give for some debuggers and static analysers
work only with `vim`.

### C programming { #c-programming }

The content of this unit assumes you already have a basic working knowledge of
the C programming language.
You will need to have access to a good C textbook in order to do well in this
unit. YouTube videos or online tutorials will not be sufficient.

The following is an acceptable C textbook which covers the C11 standard.
(It actually uses the C17 standard, but the differences for our purposes
are minimal.)

- Robert C. Seacord, *[Effective C: An Introduction to Professional C
  Programming](https://nostarch.com/Effective_C)* (No Starch Press,
  2020)

The textbooks recommended for [CITS2002 Systems Programming][c-text]{ class="hi-pri" } are also suitable.
There is no need to use the Seacord text just because I have suggested
it -- you should pick a textbook that you feel comfortable with.

[c-text]: https://teaching.csse.uwa.edu.au/units/CITS2002/c-books.php

If you are already familiar with the C99 standard, the [Wikipedia page][wiki-c11]
on the C11 standard provides a good summary of the changes. Two of the
most useful features introduced in C11 (for our purposes) are

**[static assertions][static-assert]**{ class="hi-pri" }:

:   These are an improvement on
    preprocessor-based assertions using `#if` and `#error`, because they can
    make use of information known only by the compiler (as opposed to [the
    preprocessor][cpp-assert]) -- for instance, the result of `sizeof` and `alignof`
    expressions.\
    &nbsp;

**the [atomic operations library][atomics]**{ class="hi-pri" }:

:   This allows some [race conditions][race-cond] to be avoided.\
    &nbsp;


[wiki-c11]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C11_(C_standard_revision)
[static-assert]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assertion_(software_development)#Static_assertions
[cpp-assert]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4079243/how-can-i-use-sizeof-in-a-preprocessor-macro
[atomics]: https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/atomic
[race-cond]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_condition

### Operating systems

The content of this unit assumes you already have a basic working knowledge of
operating system fundamentals.
It is recommended you have access to a good operating systems textbook in order
to do well in this unit.

The following are acceptable operating systems textbooks:

- Remzi H. Arpaci-Dusseau, Andrea C. Arpaci-Dusseau, and Peter Reiher,
  *[Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/)*
  (Arpaci-Dusseau Books, August 2018, Version 1.00)
- Ian Wienand, *[Computer Science from the Bottom Up](https://bottomupcs.com/index.html)*
- Randal Bryant and David O'Hallaron, *[Computer Systems: A Programmer's
  Perspective][cs-prog-persp]* (3rd edn; Pearson, 2015)

## Labs { #labs }

Labs begin in [week 2]{ class="hi-pri" }.
Worksheets for the labs will be published on this page as the semester progresses.
The lab worksheets contain practical exercises to reinforce concepts
covered in lectures, as well as occasional links to Moodle self-paced
quizzes, or problems for you to attempt in-class.
Some worksheets may include optional "challenge" exercises or problems for students
seeking additional challenges -- these are not compulsory, but are
provided for your interest.

Any solutions to problems in a lab worksheet will normally be published the following week,
to allow students time to work through lab problems independently.
Solutions to any "challenge" problems are typically not published, but you are welcome to
discuss your solutions with the lab facilitators or the unit coordinator if you have
attempted them.
