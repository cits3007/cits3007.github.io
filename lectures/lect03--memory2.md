# Buffer overflows

### Buffer overflows -- relevance

- We've seen a historical case where buffer overflows
  were used in a security incident (the Morris Internet worm)
- Buffer overflows are *still* a very major source of vulnerabilities
- The CWE ("Common Weakness Enumeration") database has annual "[Top 25
  most dangerous software weaknesses][cwe-top-25]" lists
  - CWE-787, "Out-of-bounds write", the category to which many buffer
    overflows belong, has been in the top 2 CWEs for 4 years running

::: notes

**baron samedit**

- affects `sudo` program, ubiquitous on Unix-like systems
  - affects Linux, MacOS, Solaris, etc
  - the bug was introduced in 2011, and not detected until 2021
  - By calling the `sudoedit` command (a symlink to `sudo`) with
    specially crafted arguments, an attacker could execute
    arbitrary code and gain root privileges.

**boothole**

- It was present from the very first version of GRUB2
  until patched versions were released in 2020
- Could affect any system w/ a GRUB2 bootloader, even if Linux
  was not being booted (e.g. windows partition)
- It allowed an attacker to control the "secure boot" process (which
  normally can't be done from within the booted OS at all,
  even by a superuser)

- boothole CVE -
  <https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-10713>

- boothole applies to all versions of GRUB2 (considered to be
  everything from GRUB 1.98 onwards) til when the CVE was patched.

  GRUB 1.98 dates from 2010 -- see e.g.
  <https://www.phoronix.com/news/ODA0MQ> from March 2010 announcing its
  release

boothole

- the overflow occurs when parsing the `grub.cfg` configuration file
  used by GRUB2 -- this file specifies how
  bootup processes like safe more and recovery mode should work

    overflowed (can overwrite stack return addresses)
  - CWE-121 Heap-based Buffer Overflow: A buffer on the heap is
    overflowed (can corrupt data)
  - CWE-823 Use of Out-of-range Pointer Offset: Pointer could

::: notes

TODO: see also out of bounds reads. e.g. heartbleed.

:::

### Underlying causes { .fragile }

\small

- a buffer (array or string) is just some space in which data can be stored.
- some languages check at runtime whether a reference to an array
  position is in bounds, others don't
  - C does not; Java and Python do
  - In C`\texttt{++}`{=latex}, bounds checking is typically optional -- e.g. if using the `std::vector`
    class, the bounds-checked alternative to `myvec[42]` is `myvec.at(42)`

```{=latex}
\begin{picture}(3,3)
\put(-0.7,1.5){{\includegraphics[width=1.1\textwidth]{lect03-images/buffer-overflow-new.eps}}}
\end{picture}
```


::: notes

- why use fixed-size buffers at all?

  why not use dynamically allocated memory?

- attacker can still cause problems -- e.g. integer overflow

locality

If you use a buffer which fits inside a [CPU cache][cpu-cache], your
code is likely to run much faster -- instead of fetching data from RAM
(a relatively slow operation), the data can be fetched from the cache
(much faster)


[cpu-cache]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPU_cache

:::


### Underlying causes

\small

- If, while writing to a buffer, a program overruns the bounds of the
  buffer, then that's a buffer overflow.
- If the data overwrites adjacent data or program instructions, that
  can lead to unpredictable behaviour and security vulnerabilities.


```{=latex}

\put(-0.7,1){{\includegraphics[width=1.2\textwidth]{lect03-images/buffer-overflow-new-exploit.eps}}}
\end{picture}
```


### Types of buffer overflow

- stack buffer overflow -- overrun a buffer declared as a variable on
  the stack.
  - Will typically
    overwrite adjacent variables and/or stack frame members
    (e.g. return address)
- heap overflow -- we overrun a buffer contained in dynamically allocated
  memory.
  - Will typically overwrite other data structures stored on the heap

### Mechanics of overflow

```{=latex}
\begin{columns}[t]
\begin{column}{0.40\textwidth}
```

\small

- Classic way to exploit these -- do *code injection*
- Insert malicious code into some predictable location
  in memory
- Trick the program into executing the
  code (e.g. by overwriting the return address of the stack frame).

### Mechanics of overflow, cont'd

- But there are other ways to exploit vulnerabilities without code
  injection.
  - you could corrupt data -- e.g. you might overwrite a variable that's
    used to select a branch of an `if` statement

:::


### Preventing buffer overflow vulnerabilities

- Re-write in a memory safe language (Java, Python)
- Audit/static analysis
- Prevent execution of injected code (e.g. segment permissions)
- Add runtime instrumentation to detect problems (e.g. sanitizers)
- Make it harder for attackers to exploit code
  and data through address randomisation
- Testing/fuzzing
- Validate untrusted input (discussed in future lectures)

### Prevention -- memory safe language

Re-write in a memory safe language (Java, Python)

- Not always possible for existing code
- Memory-safe languages may have their own disadvantages. e.g.:
  - slower
  - longer start-up time
  - need to distribute runtime
  - may not be portable to all platforms C is
  - different skill-set

### Prevention -- audit/static analysis

- Buffer overflows (and other attacks relying on "wild pointers")
  tend to arise from format string vulnerabilities
  and common errors in managing dynamic memory
- So trying to eliminate those sources of errors
  goes a long way to eliminating the problem
- Manual audits and automated static analysis can be applied
  to find such errors
- We examines these further when we look at \alert{code reviews}
  and \alert{static analysis}

### Prevention -- runtime instrumentation

It may be possible to add run-time checks to
a normally unchecked language.

- May be in the form of a library or alternative
  implementation of standard functions (e.g. `malloc`,
  `strncpy`, etc)
- Compilers such as `gcc` and `clang` offer [*sanitizers*][sanitizers]
  which can be enabled by providing flags at compilation time
  (e.g. `-fsanitize=undefined` is an umbrella "undefined behaviour
  sanitizer" for `gcc`)
  - These sanitizers can detect errors such as buffer overflows
- We examine sanitizers further under the heading of \alert{dynamic
  analysis}

[sanitizers]: https://hpc-wiki.info/hpc/Compiler_Sanitizers

### Address sanitizer

An example sanitizer --
[AddressSanitizer](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/AddressSanitizer.html),
originally developed by Google.

A refinement of earlier techniques (e.g. "Electric Fence", developed by
Bruce Perens in 1987 while working at Pixar).

It replaces the normal `malloc` and `free` functions with versions where
the memory around `malloc`-ed regions is "poisoned".

Reads and writes are checked to make sure they're not using addresses
in the "poisoned" regions -- if they are, the program aborts.

::: notes

<https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/37752.pdf>


:::


### Address sanitizer drawbacks

- Program will run more slowly (due to extra instructions being
  executed)
- Program will use significantly more memory

### Stack "canaries"

Another runtime checking approach is to embed "canaries" in stack frames

- Canaries can be e.g. random strings chosen at program startup
- Code is inserted that verifies the integrity of the
  canaries prior to function return
- If an attacker overflows a stack buffer, they won't know
  the correct value of the "canaries", so the overflow
  will be detected

### Stack "canaries"

GCC has several [options][gcc-canaries] that will enable canaries

- `-fstack-protector`: emits extra code to check for buffer overflows,
  such as stack smashing attacks, in functions GCC identifies as
  "vulnerable". \
  (Main reason: the function contains a buffer of length $\geq$ 8)
- `-fstack-protector-all`: Similar, but adds extra code to *all* functions

[gcc-canaries]: https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Instrumentation-Options.html

::: notes

why not *always* enable canaries?

ans:

- the overhead may not be worth it
- they can have false positives and negatives
- you may prefer some other, better technique (e.g. shadow stacks,
  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_stack>)

:::

### Runtime instrumentation limitations

In general, any of these techniques will reduce
performance (due to additional memory being required
and/or additional runtime checks being performed)

- However, the cost may be tolerable
- e.g. Use of stack canaries in GCC
  results in approx 8% performance penalty

If interested -- Wikipedia has an article
on [buffer overflow protection][bop], mostly focusing on
instrumentation/dynamic analysis techniques.

:::


[bop]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffer_overflow_protection

### Prevention -- address randomization

This technique is called \alert{ASLR} (Address  Space  Layout
Randomization)

Used to prevent an attacker from reliably jumping to some particular
function/address in memory.

- We start the stack and heap at some random location
  in memory
- We map shared libraries to random locations in process memory
  - This means that the attacker can no longer e.g. jump
    directly to the `system` or `exec` function

### ASLR limitations

- Fairly coarse-grained randomization
  - May be able to defeat just by making multiple attempts
- Some library routines may not be "ASLR"d
- May be able to analyse a binary and use [return-oriented
  programming][rop] to exploit it

::: notes

DEP is windows' implementation of 'read XOR write' memory segements;
see below.

:::

### Prevention -- validate untrusted input

We need to be particular careful when we're
reading and using data (e.g. especially sizes
or lengths of things) from potentially
untrusted sources. e.g.

- over the network
- from a user-supplied file


### Audit/static analysis

Programs can be manually or (partly) automatically
checked for common problems:

- Use of "unsafe" functions
- Improper use of "safe" functions
- Poor memory management practices

Static analysis tools:

Examples include Splint, OCLint, Clang Static Analyzer

We will see more on these in labs.

::: notes

TODO. cf serious code review, used at NASA -
often only 1 bug in many hundreds of KLOCs of code

:::


### Unsafe library functions

Many C string functions are *unsafe* to use because
they rely solely on the `NUL` delimiter to mark the end
of strings; so if this delimiter is missing, they will keep
reading or writing memory til a `NUL` is encountered.

These functions include:

- `strcpy (char *dest, const char *src)`
- `strcat (char *dest, const char *src)`
- `gets (char *s)`
- `scanf (const char *format, ...)`
- and many more.

In general, the "safe" equivalents of those functions should be used.

(Query: when can we use the unsafe versions?)

::: notes

ans: when we can guarantee (e.g. for strcpy) that all strings are
null-terminated and within bounds.

If we've already *checked* the length of some string `s`, then calling
`strncpy` just superfluously does the check again.

In fact, if we already have exact lengths, we may as well just call
`memcpy`.

but `gets` we should never use (it can't be used safely)

and `scanf` is nearly always the wrong choice (something like `strtol`
is usually a better choice -- scanf is a very complicated and
error-prone function)

:::

### "Safe" library functions

e.g. `char *strncpy(char *dest, const char *src, size_t n)` is a "safe"
version of `strcpy (char* dest, const char *src)`.

However, **the word "safe" here is a misnomer**. They are definitely
*safer* than the originals, but still need to be used properly.

`strncpy` will copy at most `n` characters; but it *won't*
properly terminate `dest` unless a `NUL` appears in those `n`
characters.

So the proper use is usually something like:

::: block

####

```
#define BUF_SIZE 50
char buf[BUF_SIZE];
strncpy(buf, src, BUF_SIZE);
buf[BUF_SIZE-1] = '\0';
```

:::

### An aside -- the "Annex K" functions (best avoided)

- You may come across mention of the "Annex K" functions.
- In "Annex K" of the C11 standard are a number of "bounds-checking"
  variants of many standard C functions (with names like `memcpy_s`,
  `strcpy_s`, `fopen_s`, and so on -- they're sometimes called the
  "`_s`" functions).
- You are only likely to encounter these functions on Windows.

### "Annex K" cont'd

- The "Annex K" functions were originally proposed for inclusion
  by Microsoft.
- The only widely used C compiler that implements them is Microsoft's
  MSVC compiler, and MSVC's implementation is non-conformant
  with the standard in any case.
- GCC and Clang do not implement them (and the developers
  have stated they have no plans to do so).
- So if you use them on Windows, your code will thus be non-portable
  (though implementations of the Annex K functions for Linux
  and MacOS are available).

### "Annex K" cont'd

- The functions are mostly not well-regarded amongst C developers.
- They aim to be "safe" drop-ins for the standard C library functions
  - But they require you to know the destination buffer
    size in order to use them properly; and if you know that, you
    can just use the standard C library functions anyway.
- Annoyingly, some static analysers will pop up with recommendations
  you use `scanf_s`, even on platforms where you can't do so.
  - If you can, disable that warning message.
- tl;dr Don't use the "`_s`" ("Annex K") functions.

### "W xor X" ("write XOR execute")

- Modern CPUs provide hardware support for marking segments
  of memory as non-executable
  - Both AMD and Intel processors support this
- The stack and heap can be put in non-executable memory
  - Any attempt to execute memory in those regions
    will result in a "fault"
- This general technique is called ["executable-space
  protection"][esp]
  - On Windows, you may hear it referred to as
    ["Data Execution Prevention"][dep] (DEP)

[esp]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable-space_protection
[dep]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable-space_protection#windows

### "W xor X"

- Marking memory as non-executable does *not* prevent
  data structures or return addresses from being corrupted
- It's possible to overwrite a stack return address
  with some library routine, and arrange the contents
  of the frame above it to look like arguments to that routine
- So the attacker cannot execute arbitrary code within the
  running process;
  but they may still be able to call functions like [`system`][system]
  (which executes commands via the operating system's shell).

### return-oriented programming

- Marking memory as non-executable doesn't defend against
  a style of attack called "return-oriented programming".
- A "return address" can point to any sequence of instructions ending in
  a "return" (called "gadgets")
- Therefore, it's possible to arrange the stack such that stack
  frames will execute a sequence of these gadgets, with appropriate
  data acting as function arguments
- If an attacker can find appropriate "gadgets" in library
  routines, they may be able to perform arbitrary computations
  without needing to inject code

### Further exploration -- Heartbleed

- [Heartbleed][hb] is one of the more well-known buffer overflow
  vulnerabilities
- It is technically a buffer over-*read*, resulting from
  from poor input validation in versions of the [OpenSSL][ossl] library.
- The result is a breach of confidentiality.
- [xkcd][xkcd] has a good [explanation][more-ex] of [how the vulnerability works][xkcd-hb].

# Integer overflows and underflows

### Integer overflows and underflows

Informally, "overflow" tends to be used to describe several
different phenomena.

- Intended "wraparound" of integer types in various languages
- "Underflow" -- wraparound from the bottom
- Exceeding the bounds of numbers representable in an integer type,
  resulting in undefined behaviour
- Assigning a number to a type to small too hold it, resulting
  in "truncation"

Any of these can result in security vulnerabilities, due to
a number not holding the value programmers expect it to hold.

### Causes

Most people are used to thinking of numbers as if they were idealized
mathematical integers.

For two such integers $x$ and $y$, if $x > 0$ and $y > 0$,
then $xy > 0$, $xy > x$ and $xy > y$.

But for (say) an `unsigned char`, we have $13 \times 20 = 4$.

And for a `signed char`, the behaviour is undefined (but probably,
$10 \times 13 = -126$).

### Summary

- unsigned integer types: If a new value is out of bounds,
  wrap around
- signed integer types: If the new value is out of bounds,
  undefined behaviour. Unpredictable, but often the new value
  will wrap around
- conversion from a larger type to unsigned integer type: Wrap around
  (truncation)
- conversion from a larger type to signed integer type: Implementation
  defined, but typically will truncate

::: notes

C has a bunch of unintuitive and hard-to-remember rules about int
conversion and promotion.

see e.g.
<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56604299/why-do-unsigned-small-integers-promote-to-signed-int/56604510#56604510>.

Whenever you do *any* arithmetic on smaller-than-int types, they get
promoted to signed ints (if that will hold all values of the original
type), else to unsigned ints.

An alternative approach would be (e.g.) to promote 2 unsigned int types
to both unsigned.

For reasons, the former approach was chosen for ANSI C.

The result is, on some platforms you can e.g. multiply two *unsigned*
shorts, and get a result which overflows a signed int and causes UB.


:::


### Unsigned integer wraparound

- In C, for *unsigned* integer types, their intended behaviour is that
  if you attempt to calculate a value that would go outside their
  bounds, the value will "wrap around"

  - i.e., if the maximum representable number is $N$, then trying to
    create the value $N+m$ will instead give the value $N \mod m$.
  - And likewise, values will wrap around if you try to create a value
    less than 0

### Signed integer overflow

- For *signed* integer types, exceeding the representable bounds
  for a type results in undefined behaviour.

- In practice, on many platforms the value will "wrap around".

- **However**, the compiler is allowed to *assume* that the value
  *hasn't* wrapped around. (That's what "undefined behaviour means":
  only programs with no UB have a well-defined meaning; so the compiler
  is allowed to assume that no UB ever occurs.)

### Signed integer overflow

- The consequence is that once UB has occurred, you *can't reliably check for
  it*.

  e.g. Suppose we have an `int n` containing some positive number,
  and we add one to it. How can
  we check to see if it overflowed?

  Maybe we save the value of old `n`, and make sure `n > old_n`;
  or ask whether `n < 0`.

  But the **compiler is allowed to tell us** that `n` **is**
  greater than `old_n`, because **that's what would be true**
  if no UB occurred.

  It can "optimize away" the results of checks like `n > old_n`,
  because it "knows" they must evaluate to `true`.

::: notes

**references:**

C11 6.2.5 "types", for behaviour of unsigned integer types

C11 6.5, para 5, for behaviour of signed integer types:
"If an exceptional condition occurs during the evaluation of an
expression (that is, if the result is not mathematically defined or
not in the range of representable values for its type), the behavior
is undefined."

(but unsigned ints get explicitly excluded from 6.5)

:::

### Signed integer overflow

::: block

#### Caution

To reiterate: there is no way, in standards-compliant C code,
of checking for overflow *after* the fact; the compiler can and will lie to
you. `\\[1em]`{=latex}

If you write code which tries to check for overflow after the
fact, you will receive very few (if any) marks for it.

:::


### Conversion between types

If you assign a larger integer type to a smaller *unsigned* type,
the result will just be modulo'd with the `MAX + 1` for that type
until the result is in range.

The effect is to *truncate* the value.

For example:

```C
  unsigned int  a = 0x10003;
  unsigned char b = a;
```

After the statements above are executed, `b` will be equal to 3.


::: notes

- see 6.3.1.3 Signed and unsigned integers

:::

### Conversion between types

If you assign a larger integer type to a smaller *signed* type,
the result is implementation-defined (and can include raising
an implementation-defined signal which would terminate the program).

Typically, this too will result in truncation.

```C
  signed int  a = 0x10003;
  signed char b = a;
```

After the statements above are executed, `b` will (probably)
be equal to 3.

### OpenSSH integer overflow vulnerability

This results from unexpected wraparound in `size_t`.

- See <https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2002-0639>

[Vulnerable code][vuln-ssh] is in the function `input_userauth_info_response`.

[vuln-ssh]: https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/blob/cb72e4f6d2cf63cda22484ec90142689fed288f6/auth2-chall.c#L258

::: code

####

```
	nresp = packet_get_int();
	if (nresp > 0) {
		response = xmalloc(nresp * sizeof(char*));
		for (i = 0; i < nresp; i++)
			response[i] = packet_get_string(NULL);
	}
```

	}
```

:::

\footnotesize

- `nresp` can be attacked-controlled (it means "number of responses").
- So set `nresp` to `(SIZE_MAX + 1) / 8`, where `SIZE_MAX`
  is the largest value a `size_t` can hold -- $2^{64}-1$, on my
  machine -- so for me `nresp` will be $2^{62}$.
- Arithmetic on a `size_t` is done modulo $2^{64}$.
- So `nresp * sizeof(char*)` will be `nresp * 8` (mod $2^{64}$),
  which is 0.
- 0 is a valid argument to `malloc` (though it won't actually allocate
  any memory).
- So `response` will succeed, allocating no memory, and the subsequent
  loop will immediately overflow the `response` buffer, corrupting
  data on the heap.

### Defending against integer overflow

- Use appropriate types
- Do arithmetic in a wider type
- Use compiler flags
- Use libraries or code that provide "safe" arithmetic functions

### Use appropriate types

A size or a (non-negative) count

:   \
    Should use `size_t`

Integer types with specific bit-width

:   \
    Should use `uint8_t`, `uint16_t`, `uint32_t`,
   `uint64_t`, etc.

An integer which will hold any pointer

:   \
    Should use `intptr_t`

Difference between two pointers

:   \
    Should use `ptrdiff_t`

::: notes

NB that `int` is nearly alway NOT the right type to be using in a "for"
loop.

Many for loops are iterating over "sized" things (arrays, mostly), and
should be using a `size_t` to do so.

(Also: once you know the maximum possible size of something, you should
always be using a "for" loop.

Not some bizarro "while" loop with an "i++" at the end.)

:::

### Use compiler flags

- `-fwrapv` -- Treat signed integer overflow behaviour as well-defined
  -- it "wraps round"
- `-ftrapv` -- With `gcc` on AMD64, supposed to cause the `SIGABRT` signal to be
  raised, which will normally end the program. But apparently is broken
  (see <https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=35412>)
- `-fsanitize=signed-integer-overflow` -- print error report and
  continue
- `-fno-sanitize-recover=signed-integer-overflow` -- print an error report and exit the program;
- `-fsanitize-trap=signed-integer-overflow` -- raise a trap (usually,
  the `SIGABRT` signal)

### "Safe" arithmetic

::: code

####

```C
  if (a > 0 && b > INT_MAX - a)
    abort();
  if (a < 0 && b < INT_MIN - a)
    abort();
  result = a + b;
```

:::


### "Safe" arithmetic

To do signed wraparound, if there's no compiler support:

- Convert from signed `char` to unsigned. (You can just write: `unsigned char
  myuchar = my_signed_val`.)
  The value will wrap as necessary.

- Do your calculations on the unsigned numbers. The results will always be well-defined.

- Convert back to `signed char`, in this way: if the unsigned result (call it
  `res`) is less than or equal to `SCHAR_MAX`, we're fine.

  If it isn't: modulo the unsigned result with `SCHAR_MAX`, and add it
  to `SCHAR_MIN`.


### Applicability of overflow-prevention techniques

When do we need to use these techniques?

- *All* the time? Should every use of the plus ("`+`") operator be changed to, say,
  `safe_add`?
- *None* of the time?
- Somewhere in between?

### Integer bounds in other languages -- Java

- Java *only* has signed integer types -- no unsigned types. The
  behaviour of all types is that they "wrap" around if overflow would
  occur.

- Since Java 8, it provides methods like `Math.addExact()`, which will
  throw an exception if overflow or underflow would occur.

- The JVM can still suffer from overflow errors in underlying C++ code
  -- e.g. see <https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8233144>

### Integer bounds in other languages -- Python


- Treatment of integers in Python varies from version to version.

- Typical approach is: use the underlying C `int` type by default;
  however, if a value would exceed the bounds of an `int`, it gets
  automatically promoted to an [arbitrary-precision][arb-precision]
  integer type

- How to detect overflow? One way: do the C arithmetic as normal,
  then try it with the C `int`s cast to `double`s. If the result
  differs greatly, then underflow or overflow occurred.

  (This technique turns up also in some older versions of the JVM.)

::: notes

note that both Java and Python seem to have moved away from the
"doubles" technique as being too fiddly/not reliable.

### Integer overflow -|- compiler protections

`gcc` offers *sanitizers*.

- `-fsanitize=shift` -|- check that the result of a shift operation is not undefined

  `-fsanitize=signed-integer-overflow` -|- check that signed integers
  don't overflow


::: notes

- `-fsanitize=undefined` is a general UB sanitizer; you can also enable
  specific checks

### Overflow CWE

- Has a CWE ID -- [CWE-190][cwe-190] Integer Overflow or Wraparound
- a calculation can produce an integer overflow or wraparound, but the
  program logic assumes the new value will always be larger than the
  old
- if the integer is got from a user/attacker, they may be able to
  deliberately trigger this with user-supplied inputs
- if the integer is then used to control looping, make a security
  decision, allocate memory etc then the vulnerability becomes critical

[cwe-190]: https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/190.html




<!--
Consider the following code:

::: block

####

```C
size_t len = read_num_from_network();
char *buf;
buf = malloc(len+5);
read(fd, buf, len);
```

:::

\pause

- No buffer overrun appears to occur here (in fact, we've 5 bytes to
  spare)

\pause


- But if the data from the network overflows the bounds of a
  `size_t`[^size-max], then it will wrap around to some small number
  (e.g. 4, say)


[^size-max]: The upper bound of a
  \texttt{size\_t} is \texttt{SIZE\_MAX}; it must be at
  least 65535. on AMD64 platforms, it's usually $2^{64}$.
