### Exam details

**Exam format**

:   Same as mid-semester test

**Exam rubric**

:   Available at <https://cits3007.github.io/assessment/>

    Note that short answer/numeric questions are auto-marked;
    make sure you read the question carefully and provide exactly
    what is asked for

### Due date

The exam \alert{must} be submitted before the due date and
time; just as for
face-to-face exams, exams submitted after the due time will receive a
mark of 0.

It's each student's responsibility to make sure they submit before the
due date and time.

Even if you think the LMS might let you submit after that time,
you still must submit before the due date and time

### Academic integrity

- All students must act in accordance with
  UWA's [academic conduct policy][acad-policy].
- See the STUDYSmarter team's [Guide to Avoiding Academic
  Misconduct][misconduct-guide] for additional details.

In particular, you \alert{must not} plagiarize any
work. Plagiarism is the unattributed use of
someone else's words, creations, ideas or
arguments as one's own. At UWA, it is extended to include paraphrasing
which is too close to the original.

[misconduct-guide]: https://www.student.uwa.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0007/2748139/R3-Avoiding-Academic-Misconduct.pdf

### Academic integrity

Even when quizzes, tests and exams are open book, you are expected to:

a.  demonstrate an \alert{understanding} of the answers
    you write (and may be asked to demonstrate that understanding
    orally)
b.  ensure any answers you write are \alert{in your own words}
c.  properly attribute any sources you make use of.


All exam responses (and projects) are submitted to plagiarism
detectors such as Turnitin, `moss` and `JPlag`
