<h2 id="part-a-rubric">Part A rubric</h2>
<p>Regarding marks allocation for the writing/research portion of the
project: the same rubric is used as for “long answer” questions in the
mid-semester test. (See <a href="https://secure.csse.uwa.edu.au/run/help3007?p=np&amp;opt=B104">here</a>.)</p>
<h2 id="part-b-rubric">Part B rubric</h2>
<p>Regarding marks allocation for the coding portion of the project: the
key thing being assessed is, Can you implement the spec correctly, while
adhering to good secure coding practices? (On top of general
expectations about code clarity and quality, already mentioned in the
spec.)</p>
<h3 id="general-marks-breakdown">General marks breakdown</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Implementation of the spec</strong>. Code implements the
spec: 40 marks.</li>
<li><strong>Secure coding best practices</strong>. Code follows secure
coding best practices: 10 marks.</li>
<li><strong>Code clarity and style</strong>. Code is clear, easy to
read, and follows general coding best practices (a list is contained in
the spec, under “Items to submit” / “C files”): 20 marks.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="possible-ways-to-get-very-low-marks">Possible ways to get very
low marks</h3>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Incomplete projects</strong>.</dt>
<dd>
<p>Marks for implementation of the spec (40 marks), secure coding best
practices (10 marks) and code style and clarity (10 marks) are
predicated on the project actually being <em>attempted</em>. If the code
is mostly or wholly incomplete (e.g. empty function definitions, or
function definitions containing complete nonsense/no serious attempt),
then you won’t be able to get more than X% of the marks for those
components for an X%-complete project.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Projects that don’t compile</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>There is ample opportunity to compile, test and run your code with
the exact same compiler (<code>gcc</code>) and the exact same flags
(minimum of <code>-std=c11 -pedantic -Wall -Wextra</code>) on the exact
same platform (the CITS3007 standard development environment) we will
use, so there is no good reason to submit non-compiling code. Projects
that don’t compile will receive at most 5 marks for implementation (out
of 40).</p>
<p>The marks for secure coding best practices (10 marks) and code style
and clarity (10 marks) are predicated on your actually submitting
compilable code, so at most 1 mark each will be awarded for those if
code doesn’t compile.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Projects that segfault/fail to pass minimum
tests</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Uploaded on the website is a basic “submission checker” (here: <a href="https://cits3007.github.io/assessment/#project" class="uri">https://cits3007.github.io/assessment/#project</a>) which
can be downloaded and run within a CITS3007 development environment.
It’s a setuid program, and <strong>NOT EVEN REMOTELY SECURE</strong>, so
don’t run it outside a development VM.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>
You’ll need to run <code>sudo tar xf submission-checker.txz</code>
within a VM to unpack it.</p>
<p>Given an <code>adjust_score.c</code> file, the submission-checker
will:</p>
<ul>
<li>unpack the contents of a filesystem which can be used as an isolated
environment</li>
<li>mount that filesystem and copy in your code</li>
<li>compile and link it against a sample <code>main.c</code></li>
<li>run a minimal test (incrementing the score of a user who doesn’t yet
have a record in a valid scores file).</li>
</ul>
<p>At a bare minimum, your code should be able to result in a valid
“scores” file with the correct contents, as checked for by this program.
(Actually, it should do more: to keep the implementation small and
simple, this submission-checker doesn’t instrument your code with the
Google AddressSanitizer, UBSanitizer and MemorySanitizer sanitizers,
which we will do when testing your code.)</p>
<p>Code that can’t do so will be awarded at most 10 marks out of 40 for
implementation, at most 3 marks for secure coding best practices, and at
most 5 marks for code clarity and style.</p>
<p>(NB: You can also use the submission checker to tell you, in case
you’re unsure, if you’re about to submit something that looks like a
report file [PDF or Markdown], <code>answers.txt</code> file and
<code>adjust_score.c</code> file. Invoke it as
<code>./submission-checker /path/to/report_file /path/to/answers_file /path/to/c_file</code>.)</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3 id="ways-to-get-high-marks">Ways to get high marks</h3>
<p>Assuming your code doesn’t fall into one of these 3 unfortunate
categories, marks are awarded as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implementation of the spec</strong> (40 marks).</p>
<p>Note that all programs will be instrumented with Google sanitizers
(AddressSan, MemorySan and UBSan), and marks will only be awarded if
tests pass <em>with those sanitizers enabled</em>.</p>
<p>Program produces correct results when run on scores files containing
typical data: 20 marks.</p>
<p>Program produces correct results when run on scores files containing
unusual and/or edge-case data: 15 marks.</p>
<p>Program is robust (does not segfault or crash) even in the face of
malformed or otherwise incorrect scores files and other unusual
circumstances: 5 marks. The program may terminate execution by calling
functions intended to exit the program, but should print an error
message before doing so.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Secure coding best practices</strong> (10 marks).</p>
<p>There’ll be specific things we’re looking for here.</p>
<p>Note that in an ideal project, we’d aim to not just detect errors and
halt execution (as outlined above), but also ensure any errors are
propagated up to the part of the program best equipped to
diagnose/handle them. But for this project we won’t require that. (My
code doesn’t do it.)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Code clarity and style</strong> (20 marks). When writing
code that aims to be secure, it’s <em>especially</em> important that
your code is easily auditable and readable, and that (where relevant)
you’ve justified particular approaches to security that you’ve taken. So
ensuring your code is easy to read, well-formatted, and follows general
coding best practices (there’s a list in the spec) is worth quite a bit
(around 30%, compared to the 10% that is often typical for CSSE
projects).</p>
<p>If your code contains known bugs / small portions are incomplete,
document those using the Doxygen <code>\bug</code> command in a
documentation block for the relevant function or the file as a whole. It
won’t mean you get marks for them, but it will count towards good code
clarity and style: documenting known bugs is good style.</p>
<p>It’s not necessary for every function to include a documentation
block, but major functions should; and even the most minor functions
should at least have a couple of lines of comment above them explaining
what they do.</p>
<p>Excessive <em>inline</em> comments (comments in the body of a
function) are poor coding style, as they make your code harder to read –
they will result in a low mark for code clarity and style.</p>
<p>If your code emits excessive warnings on compilation, that’s often
(though not always) a sign that you’ve done something that’s poor
style/not best practice. Good C textbooks should contain advice on
reducing warnings.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p></li>

<h2 id="general-project-advice">General project advice</h2>
<h3 id="making-use-of-the-lab-facilitation-staff">Making use of the lab
facilitation staff</h3>
<p>The lab teaching stuff will usually be happy to give general advice
on overcoming difficulties with C programming. If you’re running into
problems, then taking your code along to a lab to discuss is definitely
a good idea. But bear in mind that they are unlikely to</p>
<ul>
<li>clarify the project spec for you (you’re expected to interpret the
spec yourself, or post in the forum if the spec is
unclear/inconsistent/incomplete)</li>
<li>tell you exactly what secure programming practices to adopt (it’s up
to you to work out what’s relevant, based on what we’ve covered in
class), or</li>
<li>teach you the basics of C (that’s assumed prior knowledge).</li>
</ul>
<p>Assistance with the project is also a lower priority than covering
any required exercise material.</p>

Nevertheless, it operates at a privileged level, and assumes it’s being
